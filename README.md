# QT Trading Bot Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project is designed to develop a trading bot analyzer using the Qt framework, which interacts with a Python Flask backend. It provides functionalities such as user authentication, stock ticker searching, and real-time stock trading simulation using OpenGL for graphical visualization of stock data.

## Key Features
- User registration and login functionality.
- Integration with a Flask backend for handling user data and authentication.
- Real-time simulation of stock trading.
- Visualization of stock prices and trading activities using OpenGL.
- Ability to search and track stock tickers.

## Technologies Used
- C++ with Qt framework for the frontend.
- Python Flask for the backend server.
- OpenGL for graphical visualization of stock data.

## Project Design Overview

### 1. Architecture

The "QT Trading Bot Analyzer" utilizes a client-server architecture:
- Frontend: Developed using the Qt framework, the frontend provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can interact with the system. It handles user inputs and displays the graphical representations of stock data.
- Backend: Implemented with Python Flask, the backend serves as an API layer that handles business logic, including user authentication, data processing, and interfacing with the database.

### 2. Components

#### a. User Authentication
- The system includes a secure login and registration feature, using Flask to manage user data. Passwords are hashed before storage to ensure security.

#### b. Stock Ticker Search and Tracking
- Users can search for stock tickers using a search module built into the Qt frontend. This interacts with the backend to retrieve real-time data from stock market APIs.

#### c. Real-Time Simulation and Visualization
- The application uses OpenGL within the Qt framework to render real-time visualizations of stock data. This includes graphs and charts that update dynamically as new data is received.
- The simulation component allows users to mock trade stocks in real-time, providing an educational tool for trading strategies.

### 3. Data Flow

- User Input: Input through the Qt GUI is processed and sent to the Flask backend via API calls.
- Data Processing: The backend fetches and processes stock market data, handling business logic such as simulation states and user account management.
- Data Visualization: Processed data is sent back to the frontend, where it is visualized in real-time using OpenGL.

### 4. Libraries and Frameworks

- Qt: Used for crafting the GUI and integrating OpenGL for data visualization.
- Flask: Manages the RESTful API, user authentication, and server-side logic.
- OpenGL: Handles all graphics rendering in the frontend.

### 5. Database Integration

- Database operations are handled by Flask, which interacts with an SQL database to store user information and possibly cached data to improve performance and responsiveness.

### 6. API Integration

- The application integrates with external stock market APIs to fetch real-time data, which is then processed and sent to the frontend for display.
